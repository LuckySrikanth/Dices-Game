The code snippet is for a simple, web-based dice-rolling game involving two players. Players take turns rolling a dice, with the outcome visually represented by imported dice images. The game tracks each player's current score and displays it, along with indicators for the active player. A "New Game" button allows players to reset the game and start over, while a "Roll Dice" button enables the dice roll. The game includes a basic timer functionality that triggers a timeout alert if the game exceeds a certain duration, prompting players to start a new game. The active player switches after each roll, and special attention is given to rolling a 6, which increments the player's score. The UI updates dynamically to reflect the game's state, including the active player and current scores.
